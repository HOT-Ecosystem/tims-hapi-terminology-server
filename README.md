# hapi-compose-setup

This is an early effort to simplify the instantiation of a HAPI server. The features include:
- Docker Compose based
- Postgresql and Elasticsearch backends
- A Spring Boot executable Jar/War based HAPI runtime
- Loading of FHIR resources from one or more packages
- The ability to build the HAPI Jar/War from local source code or a remote Git repository, or download a prebuilt artifact from a direct URL or from Maven coordinates from a Maven repository (TODO).

Further documentation coming soon.
